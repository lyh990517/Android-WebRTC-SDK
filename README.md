# Overview
This project is a video call application built using WebRTC technology. With this application, you can make video calls on both web browsers and mobile devices.

# Getting Started
Here is a step-by-step guide on how to get started with this application:

1. **Creating a Room**

   - Launch the app and select the option to "Create a New Room" or a similar choice.
   - A unique number or word will be assigned to the created room.

2. **Joining a Room**

   - To join a room created by another user, enter the assigned number or word for that room and click the "Join" button.
   - When both users join the same room by using the same number or word, the video call will begin.

With these simple steps, you can set up and enjoy video calls. Share the room number or word with other users to start a call together.
